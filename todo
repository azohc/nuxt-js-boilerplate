use requestAnimationFrame and a variable velocity instead of a
variable tickrate

verify config for tooling (eslint, prettier, husky)

add firebase db to make rankings usable instead of relying on fs which
doesnt work on vercel track stats for a given alias and display on
user

add help dialog maybe on ? keyCode

factor in screen resolution to score maybe as an alternative ranking

useInfiniteScroll for leaderboards

'remember me' for alias: save/load to/from localstore: alias should be
set once and remembered (save/load) from LS from /user u can change
alias
